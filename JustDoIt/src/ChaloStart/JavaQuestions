Q29.Merge two arrays.
Q20.Merge two dimesional Array
Q15.Find the median of an two sorted arrays
Q22.Given two arrays and you have to combine them and print the median

Q2.Grouping positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers together

Q3.Problem Solving: Find the first occurance of a given number from the series which has the difference between the adjacent elements as 1. 
   For Example {1, 0, -1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} Note: Do not use Linear Search

Q23.You are given an array containing both +ve and -ve integers & required to find the contiguous sub array with the largest sum.
Eg: if i/p is(-10,2,3,-2,0,5,-15)
sum is 8-

Consider array1 ={{10, 15}, {30, 50}}
array2 ={{20,40}, {5, 10}}
Merged array should be sandwitched (array 1 should be sandwitched with array 2) 
also while merging array if value range is less than the previously added value then that value should not be added to the merged array
Output should be {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} --> 15, 5 and 10 should not be added

Q18.Write a code to for an input arithmetic equation to detect the braces and return the output in Binary 
i.e. for each opened braces there would be one closed braces.
2+((3-1)/8 ----- Output = False
2+((3-1)/8) -------- Output = True

Q4.Test Data Generation
Write the test data for the function: int getSmallestIntegerPosition(int[] A)
This method accepts as input integer array that is already sorted and rotated "n" number of items where n is less than the size of the array
For Example: The test data can be {4,5,6,1} This was derived from {1, 4, 5,6} after sorting and rotating the array for 3 times
And output of the function returns the index of integer that has the smallest value-done
Eg: {4,5,6,1}: the smallest value is 1 and its index is 3
Note: This method searches for the element and derives the position with an order of O(log(n))

Q24.s1=AMAZON&#034; s2=;ZONAMA&#034; , how will you check if any combination of characters in s2 will give string s1?

Q21.Find the nth consecutive occurence of a character in a given string. 
For example for the given input string of "Amazon is a great company as it haas AtoooZzz" and the output should be “o”:

Q20.S1: AMAZ???A??AZON??  S2: AMAZON
O/p should be AMAZONAAAMAZON..
